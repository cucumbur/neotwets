# NeoTwets
NeoTwets is a virtual pet game that lives on twitter at @neotwets and @neotwetsdev. It is currently in development by [Rick Sheahan](http://rsheahan.net) [(@cucumbur)](https://www.twitter.com/cucumbur). Please tweet me any bug suggestions or feature requests you may have! The bot is usually running all day, but it may go down sporadically. It will still respond to previous tweets when it comes back online.

## Playing NeoTwets

### Getting and Hatching a Twegg :new:
To recieve a twegg, tweet `@neotwetsdev egg`. To incubate the twegg, tweet `@neotwetsdev incubate`. Or, if you're cruel, tweet `@neotwetsdev reject` to try for a new twegg.

Once your twegg has hatched, you can name it by tweeting `@neotwetsdev name <name>`. However, if your name contains spaces it will be truncated.

### Checking the Status of your Twet :information_source:
To see how your twet is doing, tweet `@neotwetsdev status`. To see how much your twet likes you, tweet `@neotwetsdev relationship`.

### Feeding your Twet :rice_ball:
Every day, your twet will become hungry. Tweet `@neotwetsdev feed` to feed your twet. If you make sure to do this every day, your twet will really like you!

### Using Neocoins :moneybag:
Neocoins are the currency of NeoTwets. To see how much you have, tweet `@neotwetsdev wallet`. Every day, you can collect an allowance by tweeting `@neotwetsdev allowance`.
